Music Clustering and Classification Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on analyzing and clustering music data, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. The project evolved through several key stages, leveraging datasets from Spotify and FER2013 for comprehensive analysis.
Project Overview
The project began with the collection and preprocessing of a large dataset of over 114,000 songs from Spotify, focusing on audio features such as danceability, loudness, and acousticness. Initial explorations included data cleaning and visualization to identify patterns. We then applied the K-Means algorithm to cluster songs into meaningful groups (e.g., Chill, Energetic, Cheerful, Romantic) and used PCA and t-SNE for visualization. To enhance the analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were introduced for deeper feature extraction, alongside Random Forest and KNN models for classification and evaluation. Data sampling was performed to ensure balance and accuracy throughout the process.
Key Activities

Data Collection: Gathered Spotify dataset and integrated FER2013 for additional analysis.
Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data by removing inconsistencies and irrelevant features.
Clustering and Modeling: Implemented K-Means for clustering, CNN for deep learning, and supervised models for validation.
Visualization: Utilized PCA and t-SNE to represent clusters visually.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance with confusion matrices and statistical analysis.
Documentation: Prepared detailed reports and this README to document the workflow.
